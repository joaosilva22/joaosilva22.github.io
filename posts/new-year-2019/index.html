<main class="post__main">
    <p>2018 has been a good year, both from a professional and a personal stand-point. But there is always room for improvement, so this is what I hope to achieve in 2019:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Read at least one book per month.</strong> This one shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard. I think I read around 7-8 books in 2018, though it&rsquo;s hard to tell because I haven&rsquo;t been keeping track. So an additional goal for 2019 is also to track the books that I read throughout the year.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Sleep 7-8 hours a day.</strong> I mostly do this already, but I need to get better at going to bed earlier.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Launch <a href="https://www.comment-tracker.com">Comment Tracker</a>.</strong> I&rsquo;ve been working on it for maybe a couple of months now, and it&rsquo;s almost ready for launch. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t know if there is a market for it. There is only one way to find out!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Learn something new every month (and write about it).</strong> This is as much about learning as it is about getting better at communicating my ideas.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Finish my master&rsquo;s degree.</strong> Just two semesters left, so this shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Learn German. Read one German book.</strong> I&rsquo;ll be moving to Berlin, so I really want/need to learn some German.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Manage my time better (stop wasting so much time on Reddit/Hacker News).</strong> This is the most important (and maybe the most difficult) goal for 2019. If I nail this one, then everything else will fall into place.</p></li>
</ul>
