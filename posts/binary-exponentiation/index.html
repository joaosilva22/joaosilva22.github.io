    <p>Binary exponentiation, also known as <strong>exponentiation by squaring</strong>, is a fast method to compute powers of a number.</p>

<p>The algorithm looks like this:</p>

<div>
$$
x^{n} = \begin{cases} 
          x(x^2)^{\frac{n-1}{2}}, & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\\
          (x^2)^{\frac{n}{2}}, & \text{if } n \text{ is even} 
       \end{cases}
$$
</div>

<p>But why does this work? Well, the idea behind this method is exploiting the binary representation of the exponent to do less work.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s demonstrate through an example. We&rsquo;ll take the number \(4^{11}\) and write the exponent in its binary representation.</p>

<p>$$ 4^{11} = 4^{1011_2} $$</p>

<p>The binary representation of a number \(n\) has exactly \(\lfloor log_2 n \rfloor + 1\) digits. This means that we can write our number as a product with \(log_2 n\) factors.</p>

<p>$$ 4^{1011_2} = 4^{1000_2} \times 4^{000_2} \times 4^{10_2} \times 4^{1_2} = 4^{8} \times 4^{2} \times 4^{1}$$</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t look like much, but remember that \(x\) to the power of \(n\) is defined as multiplying \(x\) by itself \(n - 1\) times. So we&rsquo;ve gone from needing \(n-1\) multiplications to just \(log_2 n\).</p>

<p>Of course, we need to calculate the terms (\(x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{4}, x^{8}, &hellip;, x^{\lfloor log_2 n\rfloor}\)) themselves. Fortunately, there is a trick we can use: each element in the sequence is the square of the previous element.</p>

<p>$$ 4^1 = 4  $$
$$ 4^2 = (4^1)^2 = 4^2 = 16 $$
$$ 4^4 = (4^2)^2 = 8^2 = 256 $$
$$ 4^8 = (4^4)^2 = 64^2 = 65536 $$</p>

<p>So, to finish our example let&rsquo;s calculate the final result.</p>

<p>$$ 4^{11} = 65536 \times 16 \times 4 = 4194304 $$</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it! As we&rsquo;ve seen, the complexity of this algorithm to compute \(x^n\) is \(O(log n)\) (as \(log n\) is the number of powers of \(x\) and multiplications we need to calculate).</p>

<p>This is faster than the naive approach for large values of \(n\), and why this method is so useful in many areas of computation.</p>
