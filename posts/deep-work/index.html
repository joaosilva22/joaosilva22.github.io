    <blockquote>
<p>Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just read Deep Work by Cal Newport, in which he makes a convincing case for the value of doing deep work, not only to further one&rsquo;s career but to live a better life.</p>

<p>My main takeaway from it is that deep work requires absolute concentration, and that is best achieved blocking some hours of the day to work deeply with no distractions; no e-mail, no Hacker News, no phone.</p>

<p>A very interesting (and short) read. Worth revisiting in the future.</p>
