      <description>Binary exponentiation, also known as exponentiation by squaring, is a fast method to compute powers of a number.
The algorithm looks like this:
 $$ x^{n} = \begin{cases} x(x^2)^{\frac{n-1}{2}}, &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\\ (x^2)^{\frac{n}{2}}, &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even} \end{cases} $$  But why does this work? Well, the idea behind this method is exploiting the binary representation of the exponent to do less work.</description>

      <description>2018 has been a good year, both from a professional and a personal stand-point. But there is always room for improvement, so this is what I hope to achieve in 2019:
 Read at least one book per month. This one shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard. I think I read around 7-8 books in 2018, though it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell because I haven&amp;rsquo;t been keeping track. So an additional goal for 2019 is also to track the books that I read throughout the year.</description>

      <title>Deep Work</title>

      <description>Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
 I&amp;rsquo;ve just read Deep Work by Cal Newport, in which he makes a convincing case for the value of doing deep work, not only to further one&amp;rsquo;s career but to live a better life.
My main takeaway from it is that deep work requires absolute concentration, and that is best achieved blocking some hours of the day to work deeply with no distractions; no e-mail, no Hacker News, no phone.</description>
