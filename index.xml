      <description>&amp;ldquo;Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ve just read Deep Work by Cal Newport, in which he makes a convincing case for the value of doing deep work, not only to further one&amp;rsquo;s career but to live a better life.
My main takeaway from it is that deep work requires absolute concentration, and that is best achieved blocking some hours of the day to work deeply with no distractions; no e-mail, no Hacker News, no phone.</description>
